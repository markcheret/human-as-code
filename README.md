# human-as-code

This is the human-as-code manifest repository.

## Mission

The goal is to create a manual of sustainable operation of a human being so that humans collaboratively empower each other to thrive and reach their full potential.

## Process

In order to achieve this mission a group of humans is currently going through an agile, iterative and open process in self-governance.

### Identified steps

    - Set up a reference human model manifest:
    - Define human-environment interfaces
    - Establish human-environment interaction-maps and policies
    - Create instructions on how to self-assess required parameters for interaction
    - Create software libarary generating a human-readable format for individual instances of kind: human

Work in progress for a reference human model manifest with an instance of kind: human to be found in [Mark-Cheret.yaml](Mark-Cheret.yaml)
